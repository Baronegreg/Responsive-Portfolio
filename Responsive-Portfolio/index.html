      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/Snowtimes.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Greg Barone">

      <p>The first snowmobile was invented in the winter of 1922, when fifteen year old J. Armand Bombardier designed a wind driven sleigh with a Model T engine. Since then snowmobiling has been enjoyed by people the world over for generations.</p>
      <p>This picture of me was taken in the mountians of Colorado in the winter of 2014 when I took a week long ski trip there with some friends. This trip was the beginning of my living in Denver, CO for the next 2.5 years. These were some of the best times of my life! I had the privilege of enjoying countless adventures across the western part of the country during that time. To pay the bills and supplement my affinity for traveling, I worked as an arborist. This was fun and rewarding, but also extremely dangerous! Over time I also started to notice how that type of work was affecting the older guys who had been doing it for a while. They were having a plethora of joint and muscle issues starting as soon as their mid-late 30's. Seeing that happen regularly got me started thinking it was time for me to make a change. After some research and talking it over with some knowledgable friends in the IT world, I realized that Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was a good avenue for me to pursue. It is my hope that web development could one day become the career path that I've been dreaming of!</p>
